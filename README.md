# Music Festival Database Manager

## By: Sophia Chu, Advay (AJ) Rajguru, Damian Suidgeest

Our project provides an interface for the organizers of music festivals to organize and query their data. This allows them to plan better for future years by providing insight into trends and accumulating their data in one place for complex queries.

Built using PHP to interact with an Oracle Database instance.
